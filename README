JavaLaunch is yet another win32 java launcher (see http://tinyurl.com/5oave
for several others).  The main goal of JavaLaunch is to create an executable
which is driven entirely from an external configuration file, so you can
simple rename the JavaLaunch.exe appropriately, and outfit it with an
appropriate config file, and it will just work.  The config file allows you
to specify the classpath, as well as command line flags to the VM and java
mainclass.  The config file also does a certain amount of variable
substitution.  The following variables are substituted:

%INSTALLDIR% The directory that the launching exe was found.

%APPNAME% The name of the launching app (minus the .exe extension).

%APPDATADIR% This is essentially c:\Documents and Settings\username\
Local Settings\Application Data\%APPNAME%.

It also lets you specify requirements on the VM, such as a preferred VM
version, a minimum version, and a maximum version.

The main reasons for creating this new Java launcher are:

1. Access to APPDATADIR as mentioned above.
2. Ability to not have to "build" a new exe each time a release is made.
3. Ability to work with native libraries (required by SWT).
